Clarification: Retardation Time vs. Retardation Delay

CAI: The term "retardation time" in our analysis refers to the **retardation delay** δt,
which is the time difference between when a field is emitted and when it affects another particle.

Physical Interpretation:
- δt = retardation delay = time for electromagnetic signal to travel from source to observer
- This is NOT the "retardation time" sometimes used to describe relativistic time dilation
- Formula: δt = R/(c(1-β·n̂)) where R is distance, β is velocity/c, n̂ is unit vector

In Lienard-Wiechert electromagnetism:
- Particle A at position r₁(t) creates a field
- Particle B at position r₂(t) feels this field at time t
- But the field B feels was emitted by A at the earlier "retarded time" t_ret = t - δt
- δt is the electromagnetic propagation delay accounting for relative motion

The instability occurred because:
1. At ultra-relativistic speeds (β ≈ 1), particles can nearly "chase" their own light signals
2. When β·n̂ ≈ 1 (collinear motion), the denominator (1-β·n̂) becomes tiny
3. This makes δt extremely large, representing the physical situation where
   the electromagnetic signal barely "catches up" to the fast-moving target particle

Our fix preserves this correct physics while making the calculation numerically stable.
