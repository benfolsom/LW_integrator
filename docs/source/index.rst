LW Integrator Guide
===================

The LW (Liénard–Wiechert) Integrator repository contains two actively maintained implementations of the covariant retarded-field solver: a readable “core” transcription of the validated legacy code and an optional Numba-accelerated variant.  These pages document how to set up an environment, reproduce comparison studies, and extend the solver without losing alignment with the archived physics results.

If you are new to the project, start with the **Overview** and **Quick start** pages below.
