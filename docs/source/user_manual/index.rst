Overview
--------

The LW (Li√©nard-Wiechert) Integrator is designed for high-precision electromagnetic particle tracking in accelerator physics applications. It provides:

* Covariant electromagnetic field calculations
* Self-consistent radiation reaction treatment  
* Adaptive integration with field-based step control
* Macroparticle population dynamics
* Standard accelerator physics I/O compatibility

The software is particularly well-suited for:

* Synchrotron radiation studies requiring field accuracy
* Aperture limitation and beam loss analysis
* Radiation reaction and quantum effects
* Space charge and wake field studies
* Novel acceleration concepts requiring EM precision

This manual covers practical usage aspects, while theoretical background is detailed in the Physics Models section.
