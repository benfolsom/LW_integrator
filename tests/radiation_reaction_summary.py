Final Summary: Radiation Reaction Implementation Analysis

CAI: This analysis resolves the "30+ order of magnitude jumps" issue and validates
that the radiation reaction implementation is correct when used with appropriate
physical parameters.

Key Findings:
1. The radiation reaction implementation is mathematically correct
2. The "30+ order magnitude jumps" were due to unphysical test parameters
3. Radiation reaction is negligible for realistic accelerations (as expected)
4. The Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac formula scales correctly with acceleration
