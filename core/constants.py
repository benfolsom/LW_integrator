"""Shared physical constants for the LW integrator core.

All values use the historical ``mm/ns`` system adopted by the legacy
codebase, which keeps compatibility with archived benchmark data and notebook
derivations.  Constants are surfaced here so that tests, examples, and
downstream tools can rely on a single source of truth when performing unit
conversions or asserting physics invariants.
